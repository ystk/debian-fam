fam (2.7.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/fam.preinst:
    Add a call to start-stop-daemon in upgrade phase to forcibly
    stop all still running instances of famd.  This is because
    some old versions (at least 2.6.0-6) missed this call in their
    prerm.  This could be the cause of (now closed) bug #225636.

  * Change build to cdbs, tarball-build and simple-patchsys
    for easier maintenance:
    - adapt debian/control:Build-Depends to that
    - remove fam.postinst, fam.prerm, fam.postrm
      (now handled by debhelper)
  * Move debian/*.files to debian/*.install.
  * Compile libraries with -fPIC.

  * /etc/fam.conf:
    local_only = true
    (closes: Bug#222851)

    - 00_maintainer-mode.patch: 
      add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to configure.ac and aclocal.m4
    - 01_dnotify.patch: 
      add the dnotify monitor
    - 02_cleanup.patch:
      still the old cleanup code stolen from fedora
    - 03_autotools.patch:
      add the generated autotools code (Makefile.in, configure) so that a run
      of autoconf and automake is not needed when building this package

fam (2.6.10-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/01_dnotify.dpatch:
    Update DNotify patch from fedoras fam-2.6.8-12. This has some
    performance improvements over the old one. See
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=99364
    for more info on this. Additionally I patched this patch so
    that fam falls back to polling if dnotify is not supported.
  * debian/patches/03_gcc32.dpatch:
    Add some more fixes for compilation with GCC3. These are only
    to get rid of the warnings concerning deprecated headers.
  * debian/patches/05_largefiles.dpatch:
    Fix largefile support. (closes: Bug#191084)
  * debian/patches/06_getgrouplist.dpatch:
    Another patch from fedora, to use getgrouplist(3) in Cred.c++
    instead of iterating over groups on our own. This should
    result in increased performance, especially when not using
    /etc/groups (like in NIS or LDAP environments).
  * Remove inetd service and always start fam as daemon. Therefore,
    there are no more debconf questions, templates and config are
    thus removed. (closes: Bug#220471, Bug#216833)
  * debian/patches/*:
    Fix patch descriptions.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    Compile patch descriptions into README.Debian, for those curious
    users.
  * debian/fam.init:
    Fix restart, fam options should be given to fam when fam is started,
    not when it is stopped.

fam (2.6.10-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "next time I will buy myself a powerpc" release.
  * When disabling the maintainer-mode, config.h would only be
    created from config.h.in. A missing "USE_DNOTIFY" in that
    caused the compiler to choose IMon (and therefore the Pollster)
    to be used in the fam. This should now really close this bug.

    (closes: Bug#213474)
  * configure.in:
    include AM_MAINTAINER_MODE
  * debian/rules:
    - ./configure --disable-maintainer-mode
    - use newer config.{sub,guess} and ltmain.sh to build
      shared libraries that are named *.so (shouldn't that be
      the default?).
  * debian/control:
    - bump Standards-Version to 3.6.1.0, no changes required.
    - libfam-dev is in section libdevel

    were made to the software itself. Feel free to reopen the relevant
    bug reports if the bug is still not fixed.

  * fam.init: test for program name and program number in inetd.conf
    avoid problems with older installations.
    (closes: Bug#182501)
  * Use --oknodo in stop actions in init-script.
    (closes: Bug#185229)
  * Use dpatch instead of own patch script.
  * Don't patch configure.in but configure instead to not build-depend
    on autoconf, automake and libtool. (The same for a couple of
    Makefile.in's)
  * Provide updated autotools in orig.tar.gz.
  * Standards-Version 3.5.9.

  * debian/fam.templates:
    describe FAM's purposes so that debconf's question about
    FAM's launch mode is less confusing and downgrade this
    question's priority to 'low' because starting FAM from

    symlinks in the tarball. Added the .1 to the upstream version to get it
    into the archives.
